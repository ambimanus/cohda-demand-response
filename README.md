# demand-response-cohda
This project is a follow-up work of my PhD thesis in collaboration with the Institute for Integrated Energy Systems (IESVic) at the University of Victoria, BC, Canada. By combining my COHDA heuristic with the heat pump simulation from IESVic, a self-organizing demand response approach was developed. The results have been presented at the 2015 ICT4S conference in Copenhagen, Denmark. The paper is included here.
